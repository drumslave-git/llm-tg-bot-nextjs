/**
 * The taxonomy of LLM calls the bot makes — the axis Model performance reports on.
 *
 * Why this exists as its own dimension rather than reusing the trace's
 * `feature`/`action`: those describe the *action being traced*, not the call. One
 * handled Telegram message is a single `bot-messaging`/`reply` trace, and it can
 * contain an addressing check, several tool rounds, and a final answer — three kinds
 * of work with completely different cost profiles, previously averaged into one
 * number that moved with the mix rather than with any actual request.
 *
 * Pure and client-safe (`lib/features.ts` is the model): the id is recorded on the
 * trace event, and the UI renders the label, so no raw id is ever shown and no call
 * site invents a display string.

 * every feature but two emits exactly one kind of call, and `bot-messaging` already
 * wrote the addressing check and the reply as separately-messaged events.
 *
 * The single imprecision is `analytics-insights`, whose hour-scoring and roll-up
 * passes were indistinguishable in the old traces; those map to `insight-hour`.
 * Acceptable because this same change drops and rebuilds every insight row, so that
 * historic spend produced output that no longer exists, and the split is exact from
 * the next run onward.
 *
 * Returns null when nothing sensible can be said, so the caller can skip rather than
 * invent a category.
