/**
 * The analytics insight job.
 *
 * It scores each finished chat-**hour**'s mood, top topic, and word (one LLM call),
 * then rolls those hour rows up the calendar: hour → day → week/month → year → all
 * time, for every period a scored hour touches. That is what makes mood, "word of
 * the period", and "top topic" available at whatever period the dashboard is pointed
 * at — and, because the hour is the finest thing the dashboard plots, what lets a
 * day's mood curve exist at all.
 *
 * **Roll-ups are hierarchical, not flat.** A month is rolled up from its *days*, not
 * from its ~700 hours: reading every hour into every enclosing period would put a
 * year's worth of rows in one prompt. Each level reads only its immediate children,
 * so every call sees at most 31 entries regardless of how much history exists.
 *
 * The mood at every level is a deterministic message-weighted mean, so it never
 * depends on a fragile parse — and because a child's own mood is already the weighted
 * mean of *its* children, rolling up levels gives exactly the same number as
 * averaging the underlying hours directly. The word and topic are one cheap LLM pass
 * that *selects* among the children rather than writing new text.
 *
 * **Work is only ever added by an unscored hour.** A scored hour is final: the job
 * never re-reads it because its message count drifted, and never reconciles stored
 * roll-ups against what it thinks they should be. Both of those were self-healing
 * scans, and both made the nightly token spend a function of invisible state.
 * Rewriting a scored hour is an operator action — {@link regenerateAnalyticsInsights}
 * drops the rows, which re-arms them through the ordinary unscored-hour path.
 *
 * Fails **closed** per unit: an unusable model response leaves the stored row
 * untouched, and the hour stays owed for the next run.
