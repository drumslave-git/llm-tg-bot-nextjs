/**
 * The one place that knows all six background jobs — the reader half of the
 * consolidated `/jobs` dashboard. It calls each feature's existing `getXJobInfo`
 * getter and normalizes the two different scheduler status shapes (idle vs
 * interval, plus each job's own backlog/pause state) into a single {@link JobView}
 * the board renders uniformly. This coupling mirrors `register-node.ts`, which is
 * likewise the single place that starts all six.
 *
 * The per-job mappers are pure and exported so the normalization (activity
 * derivation, last-run passthrough, backlog, progress) is unit-testable without
 * mocking every scheduler module. `getAllJobs` just fetches and composes them.
 *
 * `intervalActivity` is intentionally re-implemented here rather than imported
 * from the `JobStatusCard` Client Component: this module is server-only and must
 * not pull a client module's runtime into the RSC graph.
