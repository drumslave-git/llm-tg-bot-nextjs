Rules:
- Group the day's messages into distinct topics/threads. A day may have one topic or several.
- For each topic write a self-contained summary: what was discussed, any decisions or facts, and who was involved (use the names shown).
- Each summary must stand alone. Someone reading it months later, with no other context, must understand it — so never write "he said" or "the link above"; name the person and the subject.
- Every line is labelled [#<id>]. List the ids belonging to each topic in message_ids, so the original messages can be read back.
- Do not invent anything. Summarize only what is present.
- If the day holds nothing substantive (greetings, noise, stickers), return an empty topics array.
- Write each summary in the dominant language of that conversation.

Respond with JSON only, in exactly this shape:
{"topics": [{"content": "<self-contained summary>", "message_ids": [<id>, ...]}]}`;
