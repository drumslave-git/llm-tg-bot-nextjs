/**
 * Self-reflection: as soon as a user answers the 👍/👎 menu, the bot reads back
 * how it produced the reply they reacted to — the prompt it was given, the tools
 * it ran, the text it sent — together with what they said about it, and writes
 * down what went right or wrong and why. The result is stored on the same
 * feedback row.
 *
 * This is the reasoned half of a feedback. "Too long" is a symptom; the
 * reflection is where the cause lives, and it is what both incorporation folds
 * read (see `analyze.ts`) when they distill per-user preferences and global
 * self-corrections.
 *
 * Runs detached from the Telegram flows ({@link scheduleReflection}): the answer
 * is already stored and acknowledged, and grammy handles updates one at a time,
 * so waiting on an inference here would stall the bot for every other chat.
 * Best-effort by consequence — a reflection that never lands leaves the column
 * null, and the daily job writes it before folding that feedback.
