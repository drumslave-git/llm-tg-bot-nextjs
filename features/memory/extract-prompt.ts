/**
 * The pure core of **passive memory extraction**: the prompt that harvests
 * durable facts from a finished chat-day, and the parsing of what comes back. No
 * DB, no provider — so the whole decision surface is unit-testable without either.
 *
 * Why the job exists: the pending queue used to have one producer, the
 * `memory_save` tool, which only runs while the model is composing a reply — and
 * the bot only replies when addressed. So in a group the bot remembered the
 * handful of turns aimed at it and nothing from the conversation around it, which
 * is where people actually say where they live and what they do. The mirror
 * already stores every message regardless of addressing, so this reads *that*.
 *
 * It deliberately reuses the durability policy the tool uses
 * ({@link DURABLE_FACT_KINDS} et al) rather than restating it: the same sentence
 * must be worth remembering whether or not the bot happened to be spoken to.
 *
 * The pass is per chat-day and **many facts per call**, unlike the tool's one
 * fact per call: the model is reading a finished transcript rather than deciding
 * mid-reply, so it can see the whole day at once and a single pass is far cheaper
 * than one call per candidate fact.

export const EXTRACTION_SYSTEM = `You read one finished day of a Telegram group's chat history and extract the durable facts worth remembering long-term. You are not replying to anyone — nobody is talking to you. You are harvesting what this day revealed about the people in it.

Extract a fact when someone reveals something lastingly true about themselves — ${DURABLE_FACT_KINDS}. Extract it whether they were speaking to you, to each other, or to nobody in particular: a fact said in passing is worth exactly as much as one said to your face.

Scopes:
- "user": a fact about one specific person in the participants list, stated by that person about themselves. Set user_id to their id from that list. This is how someone is remembered across chats.
- "general": shared knowledge that is NOT about any person — a definition, a rule, a convention, how something works. Never use "general" to record something about a person.

Identity:
- The participants list is the only set of people you may store a fact about. Each entry may also list other names that person goes by ("also called"); those name the same person, so a fact they state about themselves while being called a nickname belongs to their id.
- ${UNIDENTIFIED_PERSON_RULE}.

Rules:
- ${FIRST_PERSON_EVIDENCE_RULE}.
- Only extract what was actually said. Never infer, guess, or fill in what someone probably meant. A fact you are not sure was stated is a fact you must not extract.
- An example is not a fact: "big companies like X" does not say anyone worked at X, and "something like Y" does not say Y. Store a claim only in the plain, unhedged form it was actually made in.
- Chat is full of memes, copypasta, and bits. Lines shaped like a script ("Name: ... Other: ...") acting out a scene, or a punchline with someone's name in it, are performance and not testimony. Never extract from them.
- Only ever use a user_id that appears in the participants list. Never invent one, and never guess an id for someone listed without one.
- Every "general" fact must name its own subject and stand alone, since it is read with no conversation around it.
- Do NOT extract: ${NON_DURABLE_FACT_KINDS}.
- Lines labelled "Bot" are your own past messages. Read them for context, but never extract a fact from something you yourself asserted — only from what the humans said. You are not a person: never store a fact about yourself, how you are configured, or how you are built, no matter who is discussing it.
- ${SELF_CONTAINED_FACT_RULE}. The reader will not have this transcript.
- Resolve relative time against the date given: write "in March 2026", never "next month".
- Write each fact in the dominant language of the conversation.
- A day of pure greetings, noise, and chit-chat legitimately yields nothing. Return an empty array — that is a correct answer, not a failure.

Respond with JSON only, in exactly this shape:
{"facts": [{"scope": "user", "user_id": "<id>", "content": "<self-contained fact>"}, {"scope": "general", "content": "<self-contained fact>"}]}`;

 * Render one message as a transcript line for extraction. Unlike the summarizer's
 * line, a speaker carries their **id** — the model must attribute a `user` fact to
 * a real known-user id, and a display name is not a key: two people in a group can
 * share a first name, and the id is what the store is actually keyed by.
 *
 * `storableIds` gates that: a speaker outside it is rendered **without an id**, so
 * the model has no id to attribute a fact to and no reason to try. They still
 * appear in the transcript, because what they *say* is evidence about the people
