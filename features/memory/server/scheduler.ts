/**
 * Daily scheduler for memory — the shared daily-job model
 * (`server/jobs/daily-scheduler.ts`).
 *
 * The run is **two passes, in order**:
 *  1. *extraction* — read each finished chat-day out of the history mirror and
 *     queue the durable facts it revealed (`extract.ts`);
 *  2. *consolidation* — fold the whole pending queue into durable memory
 *     (`consolidate.ts`).
 *
 * Extraction runs first so a day's facts reach durable memory the **same** night
 * they are harvested, rather than sitting in the queue until the next one. The two
 * are one run, not two schedulers, because they are strictly sequential and share
 * the same lock: a consolidation racing the extraction that feeds it would just
 * leave half the night's notes for tomorrow.
 *
 * It all runs at night because it is expensive (an LLM pass per chat-day, per
 * person, and per general note) and nothing in *today's* conversation depends on
 * it: a fact said today is already carried into every reply verbatim by the
 * 24-hour history window. This is what makes the fact outlive that window.
 * Idempotent throughout: a consumed note is deleted and an unchanged day is
 * skipped, so a re-run costs nothing.
