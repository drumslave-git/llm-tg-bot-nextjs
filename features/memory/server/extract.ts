/**
 * **Passive memory extraction** — the producer that lets the bot remember things
 * nobody said to its face.
 *
 * The pending queue's only producer used to be the `memory_save` tool, which the
 * model can call solely while composing a reply — and a reply only happens when
 * the bot is addressed (`features/bot-messaging/server/addressing.ts`). In a group
 * that meant the bot learned from the few turns aimed at it and remembered nothing
 * from the conversation going on around it, which is where people actually mention
 * where they live, what they do, and who they are.
 *
 * Nothing about addressing changes to fix that. The history mirror already records
 * **every** message regardless of addressing, so this job reads the mirror: one
 * LLM pass per finished chat-day, harvesting durable facts into the same
 * `memory_entries` queue the tool writes to. The consolidation pass then folds
 * them into durable memory exactly as it always has — it neither knows nor cares
 * which producer queued a note.
 *
 * Collaborators are injected so the whole flow can be driven in tests against a
 * real database with a deterministic model — no LLM, no network.
