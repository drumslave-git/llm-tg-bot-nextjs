 * document, sharing {@link parseMergedDocument}. They stay two prompts rather than
 * one because they are rewriting genuinely different things — a `user` document is
 * about ONE named person and may say "they"; the `general` document is shared
 * knowledge where every fact must name its own subject.
 *
 * A `general` merge previously reconciled one note at a time (insert / skip /
 * replace) against the stored facts most similar to it, because general knowledge
 * was a set of independently embedded rows. That is gone with the rows.
