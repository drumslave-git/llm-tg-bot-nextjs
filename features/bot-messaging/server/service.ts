 * delivery, and trace recording. Collaborators (reply generation, delivery) are
 * injected so the policy is unit-testable without a live LLM or Telegram.
 *
 * Messages the bot acts on are traced. So is every message it *asked the LLM
 * about* and then stayed silent on (see {@link BotMessagingDeps.analyzeAddressing}):
 * a bot that ignores a message someone believes they addressed is precisely the
 * complaint an operator has to be able to explain, and a decision with no trace
 * cannot be explained. Chatter rejected by the cheap deterministic checks is
 * still dropped untraced — that is the bulk of a group's traffic and tracing it
