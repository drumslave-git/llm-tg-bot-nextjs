/**

 * intact) that were left un-captioned when they arrived (unaddressed / group
 * chatter). Each row is captioned by {@link describeAndStore}, which drops the
 * bytes on success, so a described row never comes back around.
 *
 * This is the job body behind the shared in-process idle scheduler
 * (`server/jobs/idle-scheduler.ts`); see `backfill-scheduler.ts` for the wiring.
 * Locking is a cross-process advisory lock; idempotency is the per-row
 * `pending` gating (a described/unavailable row is never re-fetched, and
 * `describeAndStore` re-checks status before spending an LLM call). Both together
 * mean a redeploy overlap can never double-describe a row.
