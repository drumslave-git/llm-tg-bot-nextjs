 * pass: every request carries the same system prompt, so a turn that needs no
 * tools costs a single inference and keeps the provider's prompt-cache prefix.
 *
 * Termination is progress-driven (ported from the MVP): a round with no tool
 * calls ends the loop; a streak of {@link MAX_STALL_ROUNDS} rounds that each
 * introduce no new call (a stuck or looping model) takes the tools away for one
 * final forced answer, and the result is flagged `loopDetected`.
