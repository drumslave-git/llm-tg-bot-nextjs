/**
 * Run one traced unit of work, owning the try/fail/rethrow contract that every
 * traced mutation used to repeat by hand: open the trace, run the body, and —
 * exactly once — settle it. A thrown error settles the trace as failed and is
 * rethrown; a body that returns without settling is settled as a plain success.
 *
 * The body may still settle explicitly (`trace.succeed({ outputSummary, … })`,
 * `trace.skip(…)`) to control the summary — the wrapper only fills in whichever
 * settle did not happen, so double-settles are impossible by construction.
