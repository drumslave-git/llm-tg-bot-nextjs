 * we not run since it? That question is the whole contract — it makes a run
 * idempotent across restarts (a process that comes back up after the hour still
 * runs the day's job once) and immune to drift (no accumulating "every 24h" error).
 *
 * Pure — no DB, no timers — so both schedulers can share it and it is directly
 * unit-testable.
